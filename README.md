# gRPC FTP Server

This project implements a high-performance File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server using gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call). This README provides an overview of FTP, its importance in file transfer, and how it's implemented with gRPC in this project.

# gRPC FTP Client

This Python script serves as a client for a gRPC-based FTP service. It enables users to upload and download files from an FTP server using gRPC.

## File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of files between a client and a server on a computer network. FTP operates on a client-server architecture, where the client initiates a connection to the server to perform file transfer operations.

### Key Features of FTP:

- **Bidirectional Communication**: FTP enables bidirectional communication between the client and the server, allowing for both downloading and uploading of files.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: FTP supports various authentication mechanisms for verifying the identity of users and authorization mechanisms for controlling access to files and directories.
- **Efficient File Transfer**: FTP provides efficient file transfer mechanisms, including support for resuming interrupted transfers, data compression, and bulk transfer capabilities.
- **Portability**: FTP is platform-independent and widely supported across different operating systems and network environments.

# FTP Server with gRPC protocol
 This repository showcases a robust implementation of a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server using gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call). Leveraging the power of gRPC, this FTP server offers efficient and seamless streaming methods for both downloading and uploading files. 
Bidirectional Communication: Facilitates bidirectional communication between clients and the server, allowing for real-time interaction and feedback during file transfer operations. Error Handling: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to ensure reliable and fault-tolerant file transfer operations even in adverse network conditions or unexpected scenarios. Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy integration with distributed systems and the ability to handle concurrent file transfer requests efficiently. Easy Integration: Offers a clean and modular codebase, making it straightforward to integrate the FTP server with existing systems or customize it according to specific requirements. This repository serves as a valuable resource for developers looking to implement a high-performance FTP server with streaming capabilities using gRPC. Whether you're building a distributed file transfer system, a cloud storage platform, or enhancing existing file transfer workflows, this project provides a solid foundation to streamline your development process and deliver optimal performance.

### Key Features of gRPC:

- **Efficient Communication**: gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, enabling efficient multiplexed communication between clients and servers.
- **Streaming Support**: gRPC supports both unary and bidirectional streaming, allowing for efficient communication of large datasets or continuous streams of data.
- **Automatic Code Generation**: gRPC generates client and server code automatically from a service definition file (protobuf), reducing the amount of boilerplate code required for communication.
- **Interoperability**: gRPC supports multiple programming languages, making it easy to build cross-platform and polyglot applications.

## Project Overview

This project combines the efficiency and simplicity of FTP with the modern features of gRPC to create a high-performance file transfer server. The gRPC FTP server provides seamless streaming methods for both downloading and uploading files, enabling fast and reliable file transfer operations.

## Usage

To use the gRPC FTP server, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install grpcio
   ```
3. Save the provided client and server scripts.
4. Run the server script on your server machine.
5. Run the client script on your local machine to interact with the server.
    ```
   python client.py <command> [options]
   ```
   Replace `<command>` with either `upload`, `download`, or `help`, and `[options]` with any additional options required for the command.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/grpc-ftp-server.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd grpc-ftp-server

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### Client Commands:

- **Upload**: Uploads a file to the FTP server. Provide the file path as an argument.
  Example:
  ```
  python client.py upload path/to/local/file.txt --server localhost --port 50051
  ```

- **Download**: Downloads a file from the FTP server. Provide the file path as an argument.
  Example:
  ```
  python client.py download path/to/remote/file.txt --server localhost --port 50051
  ```

- **Help**: Displays the usage message. Provide the command for which you want to see the help message.
  Example:
  ```
  python client.py help upload
  ```
### Server Configuration:

- **Changing IP and Port**:
  - To change the IP address and port the server listens on, locate the line in the server script that sets the server address:
    ```python
    server.add_insecure_port('[::]:50051')
    ```
  - Change `'[::]:50051'` to the desired IP address and port. For example:
    ```python
    server.add_insecure_port('192.168.1.100:50052')
    ```
Replace `localhost` and `50051` with the address and port of your gRPC server if they are different.

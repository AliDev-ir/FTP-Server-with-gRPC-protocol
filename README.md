# FTP Server with gRPC protocol
 This repository showcases a robust implementation of a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server using gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call). Leveraging the power of gRPC, this FTP server offers efficient and seamless streaming methods for both downloading and uploading files.  Key Features:  gRPC Integration: Utilizes the gRPC framework for efficient communication between clients and the server, ensuring high-performance file transfer operations. Streaming Capabilities: Implements streaming methods for both file download and upload, enabling optimized handling of large files without consuming excessive system resources. Bidirectional Communication: Facilitates bidirectional communication between clients and the server, allowing for real-time interaction and feedback during file transfer operations. Error Handling: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to ensure reliable and fault-tolerant file transfer operations even in adverse network conditions or unexpected scenarios. Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy integration with distributed systems and the ability to handle concurrent file transfer requests efficiently. Easy Integration: Offers a clean and modular codebase, making it straightforward to integrate the FTP server with existing systems or customize it according to specific requirements. This repository serves as a valuable resource for developers looking to implement a high-performance FTP server with streaming capabilities using gRPC. Whether you're building a distributed file transfer system, a cloud storage platform, or enhancing existing file transfer workflows, this project provides a solid foundation to streamline your development process and deliver optimal performance.
